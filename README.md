# Automated-Boundary-Testing-for-DL-Systems
Codebase for Giorgi Merabishvili's internship project on Neural Model-Based Test Generation for Deep Learning Systems.

## Installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mimicry
```

## Getting started

1. Download pre-trained networks `*.pkl` files from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/awafa/cSG2) and put them under `./checkpoints/checkpoints`.

2. Select one of the following datasets and go to the corresponding directory:
  - MNIST: `./mnist`
  - FashionMNIST: `./f-mnist`
  - SVHN: `./svhn`
  - CIFAR-10: `./CIFAR-10`


3. Adjust the default config in `./<DATASET>/config.py`.

4. Run the file `./<DATASET>/search.py` to generate frontier pairs.
